Overview for data persistence goal:
1. Select dev server
2. Install sqlite (mysql?)
  + sudo su - -c "R -e \"install.packages('RSQLite', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')\""
3. Transfer data to sql
  + transfer Master1 (copied epicdb.sqlite file from Dropbox/R-Studio/EPIC-old/data)
  + cip1
  + soc1
4. Alter any code?

.. Replicate master branch using sql input/output


# Select Dev Server

* WelcomeU - to separate production from dev.  But, would mean double the maintenance/upgrades. But prob better development vs production app management.
+ What needs to happen to make Welcome U the dev server?
++ R installed - check
++ Shiny installed - check
++ git installed - check
++ install ssh public key to login from ipad

# Install Sqlite or MySQL
* SQLite is probably a sufficient sql engine for the number of users we expect and to avoid the upkeep of MySQL
